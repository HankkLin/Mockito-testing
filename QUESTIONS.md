# Reflection Questions

Answer these questions thoroughly after completing the assignment.

## Question 1

UML Class Diagram - Following the directions on the second to last page of the directions, use draw.io to complete a UML class diagram. Save the diagram by using File -> Export as PNG and save as diagram.png. Add this png to the root directory of your project, and push it to GitHub.

## Question 2

In this assignment, you use several wrapper methods, such as those you added in Section.java as well as those already in Student.java. What is the benefit of these wrapper methods? What are the costs? Overall, would you envision yourself using wrapper methods in your own development?

In this assignment, I found wrapper methods to be highly beneficial for facilitating the transition from existing methods in 'section' to new ones in 'enrollment.' These wrapper methods acted as a bridge, ensuring compatibility and minimizing disruptions in other classes that relied on 'section' methods that were transferred to 'enrollment'. This made the code migration process more efficient and kept the codebase intact. However, it did introduce some additional complexity, potentially making the code less straightforward for those unfamiliar with wrapper methods. Overall, I see myself using wrapper methods in my own development when dealing with similar situations that require transitioning or maintaining code while minimizing disruptions and preserving compatibility.
